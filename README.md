Contact me. If you leave a good review, I'll give you 10 free proxies.

# Contact via Telegram: [@tringuyenjan12](https://t.me/tringuyenjan12) to receive 10 free proxies.

# Note: Not 100% of the proxies will work with NodePay. Typically, out of 10 proxies that work with Grass, only 3-8 will work with NodePay. Additionally, each NodePay account can accept a maximum of 8 proxies from the tool.
